# Purpose：
In order to solve the engineering and technical problems in the smart new retail shelf scene, we built the RPV11K dataset. Part of the data in this dataset comes from supermarket shelf images taken in real scenes. It is specially designed for the dual tasks of ultra-dense commodity detection and decentralized vacancy detection, focusing on key challenges such as unbalanced sample categories, large differences in target scales, and complex background interference. As an ultra-large-scale and ultra-dense shelf scene dataset, RPV11K provides high-quality benchmark data for tasks such as shelf commodity detection and inventory status analysis by accurately annotating commodity instances and vacant areas, which effectively promotes the implementation of technology and industrial applications in the field of smart new retail.
